# Evaluation and Test Playground

This web application serves as interactive layer between the `rag-pipeline` and `evaluation` endpoint. It is used to create and evaluate different RAG pipeline configurations and to test the pipeline steps interactively.

The app is built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), a Python library that allows for the creation of web applications with minimal effort. The app is hosted in a Docker container and can be accessed via the browser.
