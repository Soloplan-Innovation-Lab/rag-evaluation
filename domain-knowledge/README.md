# Domain Knowledge

There are two types of domain knowledge: information about **DevExpress formulas** and **business objects**.

This folder currently contains the domain knowledge of the business object interfaces of the ``Soloplan.CarLo.Business.dll`` assembly, as well as the DevExpress formula knowledge *(scraping DevExpress page and extracting knowledge about custom formulas from .resx files)*. The domain knowledge is extracted from the DocFX documentation of the assembly.

More in-depth information about the domain knowledge extraction and the expression knowledge can be found in the following files:

- [Business Object Domain Knowledge](./notebooks/business_logic/README.md)
- [DevExpress Formula Domain Knowledge](./notebooks/functions/README.md)
- [Workflows](./notebooks/workflows/README.md)
