# Repository for prototypes of a natural language assistant for the CarLo Integration Suite

## Topic

Supporting system integration with an embedded natural language assistant

## Description

The topic of this thesis is to investigate the potential of LLMs for providing a natural language interface to configure and implement requirements during the system integration process of the TMS CarLo.
This should support the task of defining and implementing application interfaces and related CarLo Workflows within the CarLo Integration Suite. The goal is to make the Low-code capabilities of the application more accessible and to enable non-technical employees to define their business needs without requiring in-depth implementation knowledge. In addition to bootstrapping functionalities, this interface should also provide guidance and support for the current context and suggest common use-cases and best practices (aka. “a Copilot for the Low-Code CarLo Integration Suite”). This can be supported by using orchestration frameworks like Semantic Kernel.

## Tasks

1. Explore and identify potential LLM use-cases during the system integration process in the CarLo Integration Suite
2. Design and implement a prompting architecture for supporting the CarLo Integration Suite
3. Implement a CarLo module based on the designed architecture
