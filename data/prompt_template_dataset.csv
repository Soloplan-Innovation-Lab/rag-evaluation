Document 1:

</formula_context>

Document 1:
Interface: ITour
Summary: Represents a tour.
Properties:
- Truck
   - Type: IVehicle
   - Description: Gets or sets the truck.

Document 2:
Interface: IVehicle
Summary: A vehicle.
Properties:
- VehicleGroups
   - Type: IVehicleGroup
   - Description: Gets the groups this vehicle belongs to.

Interface: IVehicleGroup
Summary: Group of vehicles.
Properties:
- Designation
   - Type: System.String
   - Description: Gets or sets the designation.
</textual_domain_knowledge>

Reasoning:
1. Search for relevant textual domain knowledge.
2. Extract the necessary information. `ITour` and its property `Truck`. `Truck` is of type `IVehicle`. `IVehicle` has a property `VehicleGroups` of type `IVehicleGroup`. `IVehicleGroup` has a property `Designation`. All required properties are available and found.
3. Search for relevant formula creation context.
4. The `ItemsToText` function is suitable for this task. It can be used to concatenate the designations of the vehicle groups of the truck of the current tour.
5. Create the formula using the `ItemsToText` function. The `CollectionPropertyPath` is `'[ITour.Truck.VehicleGroups]`, the `SelectorExpression` is `'[First]'` (as we want the first `Designation`), the `ItemToStringExpression` is `'[Designation]'` and the `Separator` is `';'`.
6. The resulting formula is: ItemsToText([ITour.Truck.VehicleGroups], '[First]', '[Designation]', ';').
