[Thinking process to create the formula: Use the ItemsTotext of the formula_context to create the formula. Inspect the provided textual_domain_knowledge to access the necessary properties. ITour provides ""Truck"", which is of type IVehicle. IVehicle contains a property called ""VehicleGroups"". These can be used to set the ""CollectionPropertyPath"" in the ItemsToText function. As the ""ItemToTextExpression"", use the ""Designation"" property of IVehicleGroup. The ""Separator"" should be set to a semicolon.]";"ItemsToText([ITour.Truck.VehicleGroup], '[First]', '[IVehicleGroup.Designation]', '; ', '''''')"
